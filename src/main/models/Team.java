/*
    Represents a team that will run one or more heats during the event
    Purpose: Control the heats the team is running in, their times and their team information
    Contains:
    - Team Type - TeamType
    - League Type - LeagueType
    - The id of the heat in which they are currently running, -1 if they are not running at the moment - int
    - Possibility of undoing the start of the heat - boolean
    - Team id used by db and access - UNIQUE - int
    - Team number used by participants and the program - UNIQUE - int
    - TeamÂ´s name - String
    - All the heats this team is running in - Map<Integer, Heat>
    - All the TeamHeats that the team finished - Map<Integer, TeamHeat>
    - All the TeamHeats that the team has not finished - Map<Integer, TeamHeat>

    Usage:
    -

    Persistence:
    - This class is an entity in the table name "team_table"
    - currentHeatID, heats, doneHeats and remainingHeats will be changing during the program's life they
        must be persist with db, all other vars will not change much or at all
    - Many To Many relation with Heat, it is mapped by Heat
    - One To Many with TeamHeat x2
