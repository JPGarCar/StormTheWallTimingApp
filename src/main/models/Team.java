/*
    Represents a team that will run one or more heats during the event
    Purpose: Control the heats the team is running in, their times and their team information
    Contains:
    - Pool Name - String
    - Team id used by db and access - UNIQUE - int
    - Team number used by participants and the program - UNIQUE - int
    - TeamÂ´s name - String
    - All the Runs that the team has - Map<Integer, Run>
    - Team unit that represents the unit of this team - String

    Usage:
    -

    Persistence:
    - This class is an entity in the table name "team_table"
    - currentRun, heats and runs will be changing during the program's life they
        must be persist with db, all other vars will not change much or at all
    - Many To Many relation with Heat, it is mapped by Heat
    - One To Many with Run
