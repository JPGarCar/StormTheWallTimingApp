/**
 * Represents a day of the race. It will contain all the Heat(s) to run during the day, will also keep track of
 * the next heat number. Will also deal with what needs to happen when the past Heat has to undo.
 *
 * There can not be any duplicate Heat(s) associated to a Day.
 *
 * Heat(s) numbers must follow a numerical order without jumping any numbers, aka 101 -> 102 -> 103, etc no 101 -> 103
 *
 * Purpose: Control the Heat(s) to be run during that day.
 *
 * Contains:
 *   - String representation of the day, ex "Saturday" - String
 *   - Integer representation of the day, starts at 1 in chronological order - int
 *   - Next heat number to be staged - int
 *   - All the heats that will run during this day, key is the heatÂ´s number - Map<Integer, Heat>
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - main timing controller to advance current heat (atHeat)
 *   - main timing controller to get heat by its number
 *   - main timing controller to undo the last heat start
 *   - Heat to add/remove a heat to this day
 *
 *
 * Persistence:
 *   - Class is an entity in the db in table name "day_table"
 *   - atHeat and heats will be changing throughout the program life, dayToRun and dayNumber not much
 *       will have to keep persistent with db
 *   - One to Many relation with Heat, aka a Day can have many Heat(s) but every Heat can only have one Day associated
